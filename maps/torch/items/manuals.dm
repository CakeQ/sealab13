	<b>SUBJECT:</b> RE: Testing Materials<br>
	<hr>
	We have reviewed your request, and would like to make an addition to the list of needed materials.<br>
	As we hold very high hopes for this branch, it would be only right to provide our scientists with the most accurate testing environment. And by that we mean the living human subjects. Our Ethics Review Board suggested a workaround for that pesky 'consent' requierment.<br>
	In the Research Wing you should find a small section labeled 'Aux Custodial Supplies'. Inside we have provided several mind-blank vatgrown clones. Our Law Special Response Team so far had not found SCG legislation that explicitly forbids their use in research.<br>
	They come in self-contained life support bags, with additional measures to make them easier to use for, let's say, more sensitive personnel. As our preliminary study showed, 75% more subjects were more willing to harm a (consenting) intern if their face was fully hidden.<br>
	We are expecting great results from this program. Do not disappoint us.<br>

	Your orders are to visit following star systems. Keep in mind the supply limits of your vessel and ration exploration time accordingly.

	<li>[generate_system_name()]</li>
	<li>[generate_system_name()]</li>

	<li>[generate_system_name()]</li>
	<li>[generate_system_name()]</li>
	<br>
	Priority targets are: artifacts of uncontacted alien species, signal sources of unknown origin.<br>
	None of the systems are claimed by any entitety recognized by SCG, so you have full salvage rights on any derelicts discovered.<br>
	Investigate and mark any prospective colony worlds as per usual procedures.<br>
	There is no SCG presence in that area. In case of distress calls, you will be only vessel available, do not ignore them. We cannot afford any more PR backlash.<br>
	Report all findings via bluespace comm buoys during inter-system jumps.<br>

	<hr>
	This is a small addenum to usual operating procedures. Unlike usual SOP, this is not left to Commanding Officer's discretion. As unconventional that is, we felt it is essential for smooth operation of this mission.<br>
	Procedure can be initiated only by transmission from SCG Expeditionary Command via secure channel. The sender may not introduce themselves, but you shouldn't have trouble confirming the transmission source I believe.<br>
	The signal to initiate the procedure are codewords 'GOOD NIGHT WORLD' used in this order as one phrase. You do not need to send acknowledgement.
	<li>Information about expedition's findings is to be treated as secret vital to SCG's national security, under codeword UMBRA. Only SCG government employees, NT personnel and Skrell citizens aboard SEV Torch are allowed access to it if they need it in course of their duties.</li>
	<li>It applies retroactively. Any non-cleared personnel that was exposed to such information are to be secured and transferred to DIA on arrival to home port.</li>
	<li>Any devices capable of transmitting data on interstellar range are to be confiscated from private possession.</li>
	<li>Disregard any systems remaining on flight plan, set course of Sol, Neptune orbit. You will be contacted on your arrival. Do not make stops in ports on the way unless absolutely necessary.</li>
	<br>
	It may seem a bit drastic, but I assure you, it's a simple precaution just in case. Just keep it in mind, and carry on with your normal duties!
