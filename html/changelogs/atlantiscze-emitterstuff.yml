changes: 
  - tweak: "Blobs are now considerably more resistant to energetic weapons, be it handheld lasers, energy guns, or even emitters. An emitter is still useful to suppress the blob a bit, but one emitter shouldn't be capable of outright killing the blob."
  - rscadd: "Blob has a relatively small chance to grow secondary cores. These cores are considerably weaker, have lower health, but still help spread the blob a bit more."
  - tweak: "Emitter power usage increased (30kW to 100kW). While it is still possible to run one with PACMAN, you have to keep it on overload."
  - tweak: "Reinforced walls are now considerably more resistant against projectiles of all kinds, be it emitters, handheld weaponry, or anything else. Regular walls are unaffected. An emitter is still useful if you need to burn through one, but expect to wait - it needs over fifty pulses for a plasteel reinforced wall."
  - tweak: "Details on the above. Reinforcement is calculated from the material that is used to reinforce the girders when building the wall. Weak materials such as wood have 0% reduction in taken damage. Most basic materials have 50% or so. Steel is decent material with 80% reduction. Plasteel is very good with 90%, and titanium is the best with approx. 92% reduction (though it has lower overall health)"
