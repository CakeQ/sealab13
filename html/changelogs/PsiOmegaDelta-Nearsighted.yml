changes: 
  - tweak: "The impaired Resomi vision is now represented by the oxygen overlay rather than the welding overlay."
  - tweak: "Vision impairment from wearing a welding mask now stacks with nearsightedness due to now being two separate effects."
  - tweak: "Species and individual specific nearsightedness now stacks, i.e. a nearsighted Resomi won't be aided at all to the same degree by the standard prescription glasses as other species would be."
  - tweak: "Glasses can now have varying degrees of prescription."
