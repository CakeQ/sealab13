changes: 
  - rscadd: "hydroponics trays, covers, and plump helmets have been re-sprited."
  - tweak: "Plump helmets are now repeatedly harvest-able, but require a high amount of nutriment to sustain. You only harvest the 'helmet' of the plump helmet, as well."
  - tweak: "Hydro trays will default to 5 lumen lighting for their covers"
