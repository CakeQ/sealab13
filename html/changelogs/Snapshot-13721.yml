changes:
  - rscadd: "Moved airlock electronics, brig doors, portable canisters, and cargo computers over to TGUI"
  - tweak: "Cargo ordering computers have been completely reworked. Both the supply and ordering computer have been merged into one which can be logged into or out of by a crew member with cargo access. The computers will allow only one computer to be logged in as a register at a time and orders cannot be placed without a register active."
  - tweak: "The cargo ordering system has been tweaked to allow requests even when there are not enough points available so that cargo can queue items into their cart at their discretion. Items moved to the cart can be demoted back to requests as well."
  - rscadd: "The cargo computer now allows crew members to print a receipt of their requests for their onw use."
  - soundadd: "Added sounds for printing from the cargo computer for more ambient sounds."
  - experiment: "The cargo computer will quietly beep whenever a successful ui button press is completed. This is an experimental test to see if more ambience can be added without becoming too much of an annoyance."
