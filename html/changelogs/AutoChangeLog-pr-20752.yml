  - rscadd: "You can now deface people's heads by targeting it with help intent and using a pen, crayon, or lipstick -- even if it's no longer attached. Heads with shoulders below them can be gentrified using a shower, or in a sink otherwise."
  - bugfix: "You can no longer apply lipstick to things without lips."
