changes: 
  - bugfix: "When reattaching limb, hemostat finish step is REQUIRED now. On the other hand, limbs are now properly reattached without leaving cut-away status forever."
  - tweak: "For bone gel steps you can use duct tape now. Screwdrivers aren't used anymore. Also reworded messages there to be less awkward."
