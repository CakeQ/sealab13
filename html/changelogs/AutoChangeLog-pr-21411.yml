changes: 
  - rscadd: "The crisis borg module comes with a stasis bag rack, which can hold 3 body bags or stasis bags. Starts empty to avoid exploits: go find your own."
  - tweak: "Borgs now fold up roller beds by clicking and dragging, like everyone else."
  - tweak: "Borg interactions with ironing boards while having the roller rack equipped are similar to humans (they still can't iron, though)."
