  - tweak: "Bluespace jump effects have changed. Engineers found that some duct tape got unstuck because of a WD40 leak, so they fixed it. Now you can't zoom through the walls, and visibility is a bit better. You also don't get confused forever, just for a minute or so. There are some... unforseen side effects, but they seem harmless. A word from Chief Tech (before his disappearace) - KEEP IT REAL."
