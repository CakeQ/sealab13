changes: 
  - tweak: "The limb damage indicator on the HUD now uses local limb pain, not traumatic shock."
  - tweak: "custom_pain() (used in surgery, moving bones, etc, to make a pain message) now increases pain on the limb calling it. In other words, non-anesthetised surgical pain now has a purpose other than giant red text."
