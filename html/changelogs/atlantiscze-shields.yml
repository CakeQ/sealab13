changes: 
  - rscdel: "Removed bubble shield generators, hull shield generators and shield capacitors. Also removed shield disrupter."
  - rscadd: "Added a replacement advanced shield generator, that has a combined function of a capacitor, and both shield generators (hull shielding is toggleable). This shield generator must be built and once constructed is immobile (but can be deconstructed again). These generators are fully configurable, have better hull shielding that doesn't block shuttles, mass drivers and others, and have different energy system. Damage will drain the shield's energy directly."
  - rscadd: "Added Shield Diffusers. Two variants exist - floor mounted and handheld. The handheld variant can be purchased from traitor uplink, and runs on an internal cell. The floor mounted variant layers under floor tiles and is APC powered. These diffusers dissipate shields in adjacent tiles (+ shaped pattern). The generator can be set to try to counter these, in which case each diffuser causes major EM strain on the shield."
  - maptweak: "Added two shield generator circuit boards and two shield diffuser circuit boards into tech storage."
