changes: 
  - rscdel: "Construction robot module removed"
  - rscadd: "Engineering robot module now contains most tools of construction robot, primarily plasteel. RCD is not included by default."
  - rscadd: "Engineering Robot RCD upgrade is now buildable. This upgrade unlocks robot's RCD. It is fairly expensive, requiring small amount of gold and silver, as well as phoron and steel to build."
  - rscadd: "Floodlight upgrade added. This upgrade doubles robot's light intensity (it will be more or less same as actual floodlight), at the cost of higher power usage."
  - rscadd: "You may now install matter bin into a cyborg in order to boost it's matter synth's maximal capacity. Better matter bin adds more capacity"
  - tweak: "Default capacity of matter synths for engineering module tweaked a little, since prices of reinforced walls, etc. increased recently. Steel changed from 40 to 60 sheets default, plasteel from 10 (Construction default) to 20."
