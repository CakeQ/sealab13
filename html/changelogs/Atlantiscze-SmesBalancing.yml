changes: 
  - rscadd: "SMES units now try to balance their inputs and outputs. For outputs this means two SMESes powering the same grid will share the load by percentage. For inputs, all SMESes inputting from one power network will split the available power by percentage."
  - tweak: "Some minor SMES configuration changes have been made: Atmospherics SMES now starts configured to prevent power outages when people forget about it, engine SMESes are now configured to input/output at full rate. These are only defaults and may be changed ingame as usual."
