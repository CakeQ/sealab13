changes: 
  - rscadd: "Fire extinguisher may now accept fluids from all forms of reagent containers (HCL dispensers, capsaicin dispensers, coolant tanks, fuel tanks etc.) and spray them at EXTREMELY low levels of efficiency (100 units a spray, wasteful for most things.) Firefighter extinguishers may also accept in the same way. BEWARE."
  - tweak: "Water may now cool down to 20c when sprayed (Includes grenades, for example.), with a diminishing return below 60c."
  - rscadd: "Like the above, coolant may be used to cool areas, best saved for phoron fires or traitoring, because it's extremely efficient and may dip an area to just a little over 0 kelvin if you're not careful."
  - tweak: "Extinguishers will fire multiple puffs of reagents instead of three sprays at the exact same time. More or less consequence of a performance change."
