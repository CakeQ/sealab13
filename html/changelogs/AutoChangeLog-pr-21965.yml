changes: 
  - tweak: "Zombie abilities now tell you when they can't be used, why, and how long is left on their cooldown, instead of failing silently."
  - bugfix: "Zombies can no longer consume or death_breath while incapacitated."
  - balance: "Zombies can only death_breath once per minute instead of once per second(!)."
  - tweak: "Zombie consume now completes at the same rate as its cooldown, preventing multiple consume actions being active at once."
  - bugfix: "Zombie consume no longer allows the user to be the target."
  - balance: "Zombification doesn't magically replace robot parts"
  - balance: "Zombification organ health bonus is x3 instead of x5, but organ break threshold is 75% instead of 50%"
  - balance: "Zombie toxin urn reduced from 120u(!) to 10u."
  - tweak: "Zombie toxin now guarantees conversion for a 5u or greater dose."
  - balance: "Zombie toxin has a flat per process 20% chance to convert so long as the current + historic amount of reagent in the victim (ie, the total dose at one time) is more than 1u."
  - balance: "Zombie death_breath now only creates 2u instead of 5u. This means a victim should usually take about 15 tox and have two 20% chances to be zombified if a single zombie breathes on them. Zombies can work together to push a victim over the 5u mark and instantly zombify them."
  - balance: "Zombies cannot re-zombify themselves for a free rejuv."
