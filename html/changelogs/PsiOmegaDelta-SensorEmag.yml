  - rscadd: "Because suit sensors can be affected externally a multitool can now be used to (un)lock the controls, to for example allow re-adjusting prisoner uniforms."
  - rscadd: "Because suit sensors can be locked the antag uplink now offers tools and services which are able to jam suit sensors in various ways."
  - rscadd: "Adds random events which will garble suit sensor data."
