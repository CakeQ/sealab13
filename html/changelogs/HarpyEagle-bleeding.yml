changes: 
  - rscadd: "Adds applying pressure to body parts to reduce bleeding. With desired body part selected, help-intent click yourself or get an aggressive grab, then help-intent attack with the grab item. Each person should only be able to apply pressure to one body part on one person at a time, so choose wisely. Applying pressure will get blood on your hands."
  - rscadd: "Splints and hardsuits that support broken limbs will automatically apply pressure."
  - rscadd: "Wounds that require treatment (e.g. bandage) to stop bleeding will be bolded in the examine output. Wounds that will eventually stop bleeding on their own are not bolded."
  - tweak: "Rigsuits now only support limbs when online."
