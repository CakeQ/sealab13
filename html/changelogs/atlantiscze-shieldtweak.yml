changes: 
  - tweak: "Shield generator configuration has been tweaked. Shield generators upkeep power is reduced considerably (stationwide shield is approx. 1.1MW at full strength). Shields still use a lot of power when regenerating."
  - tweak: "Shield capacitors now act as actual capacitors. Their power storage is 2 GJ, and maximal input 4MW, as opposed to 8MJ/400kW it was now."
  - tweak: "Shield generator+capacitor UI now displays in kilowatts and megawatts instead of watts where applicable."
