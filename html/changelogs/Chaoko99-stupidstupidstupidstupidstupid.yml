# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - tweak: "Changed the defib failure messages. Now it is less likely to lie outright to you, and medical will no longer need to know the ancient defib rituals. The machine will tell them the fix instead."
  - tweak: "Defib units now start with an APC power cell (Down from advanced) for R&D to replace as the round goes on. The APC cell will be able to shock the patient five times before needing to recharge (Down from ten.)"
