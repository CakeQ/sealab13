changes: 
  - experiment: "Sounds are now heard from 14 tiles away by default, rather than 21. If the station becomes too quiet this can be adjusted."
  - soundadd: "New sounds added for when electrifying the door or rising and dropping bolts. Requires adjacency to hear but ensures some foreplanning is needed to remain stealthy."
  - soundadd: "The airlock close sound is now different from the airlock open sound."
  - soundadd: "Changes the airlock-blocked sound and reduces the range at which it's heard."
