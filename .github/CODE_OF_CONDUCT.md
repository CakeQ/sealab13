# Code of Conduct
In order to foster a more healthy, productive and friendly contributing environment, the following code is in effect.

Accumulating three warnings will result in a repository ban. 
* The first issued ban against your account will result in a **one week ban**, which cannot be appealed.
* The second issued ban against your account will result in a **one month ban**, which may be appealed after two weeks.
* The third issued ban against your account will result in a **permanent ban**, which may be appealed after two months.
* Every subsequent ban will result in a permanent ban until appeal as described above.
* Fully serving a ban or successfully appealing a ban will remove the oldest warning, resulting in two. 

Warnings expire in six months.

**Extreme violations of this code of conduct may result in community or game server bans.**
